# GEM_turbokit

This project is a modern version of the original Turbokit offered by Generalmusic for the S2/S3 series of synthesizers.
Installing this kit requires a certain degree of modification of the original board of the synth. Do not attempt it if you are not acquainted with such projects.

## The board

I routed a 4-layer board with stack PWR/signal/signal/GND, that is a little unusual. Here are pictures of the four layers of the version 1.0 of the board.

## Sources

The main inspiration for this project came from this page: https://www.hackster.io/DitroniX/gem-generalmusic-s2-s3-series-synth-retrofit-turbokit-c30f63

I carefully checked DitroniX's schematics along with the original GEM's Turbokit and things seem to align. I chose to follow DitroniX route for the configuration of the SCSI select lines.
